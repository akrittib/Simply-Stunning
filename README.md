# Simply Stunning # 

Our teams submission to ElleHacks 2025

## Issue we choose to address ##

We chose to focus on the Adolescence Stage among the 4 Stages of Life. With social media being such an integral part of adolescent life, unrealistic body standards have become the norm. With this an increase in dissatisfaction with body images has followed, which leads to unhealthy bodies and mindsets among many adolescents who feel they need to reach those standards.

## Our Solution ##

Simply Stunning aims to assist adolescents in creating and maintaining a positive body image of themselves - to feel stunning on both the inside and outside -, by providing positive advice, backed with healthy activities and encouragement. We also provide a collection of helpful resources to further work on your body image. This is especially useful with the difficulty of finding proper resources through the internet.

## How It Works ## 

For the frontend, we used HTML/CSS and JavaScript, to create the website, and Adobe to create our designs.
For the backend, we used Flask (Python) with Gemini AI to create the friendly chat bot, Sana.
For the presentation, we used Canva.
